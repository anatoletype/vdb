# Epigraphy, signs, vernacular letters, etc.
*Collecting the collectors...*

## Drafting specifications for a future website / app.

### Motivations
The amount of resources about "vernacular letters" is quite impressive and growing, as well as peoples interested in those topics.
But they are spread out over the web without being necessarily linked together.  
Flickr as shown to be a nice hub, but has its own limits.  
I felt the urge to start a list of all website / online resources I had known of. This expanded to books.  
List started in January 2014  
Invited @hardwig, @fritzgroegel to join.  
So at first, just a really simple ressources sharing thing, not a picture sharing / uploading system.
